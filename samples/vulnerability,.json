Modern implementations of TLS 1.0 mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.\n\nAs of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that arenâ€™t enabled for TLS 1.2 and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.\n\nPCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30, 2018, except for POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits.",
